                    <p>A car rental, hire car, or car hire agency is a company that rents automobiles for short periods of time, generally ranging from a few hours to a few weeks.<p>It is often organized with numerous local branches (which allow a user to return a vehicle to a different location),</p>
					<p>and primarily located near airports or busy city areas and often complemented by a website allowing online reservations.</p>
                    <p>Car rental agencies primarily serve people who require a temporary vehicle, for example those who do not own their own car,</p>
					<p>travelers who are out of town, or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Car rental agencies may also serve the self-moving industry needs, by renting vans or trucks,</p>
					<p>and in certain markets other types of vehicles such as motorcycles or scooters may also be offered.Alongside the basic rental of a vehicle, car rental agencies typically also offer extra products such as insurance, global positioning system (GPS) navigation systems, entertainment systems, and even such things as mobile phones.</p>
